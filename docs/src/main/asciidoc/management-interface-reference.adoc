By default, Quarkus exposes the _management_ endpoints under `/q` on the main HTTP server.
The same HTTP server provides the application endpoints and the management endpoints.

This document presents how you can use a separate HTTP server (bound to a different network interface and port) for the management endpoints.
It avoids exposing these endpoints on the main server and, therefore, prevents undesired accesses.

== Enabling the management interface

To enable the management interface, use the following **build-time** property:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.management.enabled=true
----

By default, management endpoints will be exposed on: `http://0.0.0.0:9000/q`.
For example, `http://0.0.0.0:9000/q/health/ready` for the readiness probe.

SmallRye Health Checks, SmallRye Metrics, and Micrometer endpoints will be declared as management endpoints when the management interface is enabled.

== Configure the host, port and scheme

By default, the management interface is exposed on the interface: `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) and on the port `9000` (`9001` in test mode).
It does not use TLS (`https`) by default.

You can configure the host, ports, and TLS certificates using the following properties:

* `quarkus.management.host` - the interface / host
* `quarkus.management.port` - the port
* `quarkus.management.test-port` - the port to use in test mode
* `quarkus.management.ssl` - the TLS configuration, xref:http-reference#ssl[same as for the main HTTP server].

Here is a configuration example exposing the management interface on _https://localhost:9002_:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.management.enabled=true
quarkus.management.host=localhost
quarkus.management.port=9002
quarkus.management.ssl.certificate.key-store-file=server-keystore.jks
quarkus.management.ssl.certificate.key-store-password=secret
----

IMPORTANT: Unlike the main HTTP server, the management interface does not handle _http_ and _https_ at the same time.
If _https_ is configured, plain HTTP requests will be rejected.

== Configure the root path

Management endpoints are configured differently than standard HTTP endpoints.
They use a unique root path, which is `/q` by default.
This management root path can be configured using the `quarkus.management.root-path property`.
For example, if you want to expose the management endpoints under `/management` use:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.management.enabled=true
quarkus.management.root-path=/management
----

The mounting rules of the management endpoints slightly differ from the ones used when using the main HTTP server:

* Management endpoints configured using a _relative_ path (not starting with `/`) will be served from the configured root path.
For example, if the endpoint path is `health` and the root path is `management`, the resulting path is `/management/health`
* Management endpoints configured using an _absolute_ path (starting with `/`) will be served from the root.
For example, if the endpoint path is `/health`, the resulting path is `/health`, regardless of the root path
* The management interface does not use the HTTP root path from the main HTTP server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `quarkus.http.root-path` property is only applied to the main HTTP server and not to the management interface.
In addition, the `quarkus.http.non-application-root-path` property is not used for endpoint exposed on the management interface.
====

== Create a management endpoint

SmallRye Health Checks, SmallRye Metrics, and Micrometer endpoints will be declared as management endpoints when the management interface is enabled.

NOTE: if you do not enable the management interface, these endpoints will be served using the main HTTP server (under `/q` by default).

Extensions can create a management endpoint by defining a _non application_ route and calling `management()` method:

[source, java]
----
@BuildStep
void createManagementRoute(BuildProducer<RouteBuildItem> routes,
        NonApplicationRootPathBuildItem nonApplicationRootPathBuildItem,
        MyRecorder recorder) {

    routes.produce(nonApplicationRootPathBuildItem.routeBuilder()
        .management() // Must be called BEFORE the routeFunction method
        .routeFunction("my-path", recorder.route())
        .handler(recorder.getHandler())
        .blockingRoute()
        .build());
    //...
}
----

If the management interface is enabled, the endpoint will be exposed on: `http://0.0.0.0:9000/q/my-path`.
Otherwise, it will be exposed on: `http://localhost:8080/q/my-path`.

IMPORTANT: Management endpoints can only be declared by extensions and not from the application code.

[[reverse-proxy]]
== Running behind a reverse proxy


Quarkus can be accessed through proxies that generate headers (e.g. `X-Forwarded-Host`) to preserve information about the original request.
Quarkus can be configured to automatically update information like protocol, host, port and URI to use the values from those headers.

IMPORTANT: Activating this feature can expose the server to security issues like information spoofing.
Activate it only when running behind a reverse proxy.

To set up this feature for the management interface, include the following lines in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.management.proxy.proxy-address-forwarding=true
----

To constrain this behavior to the standard `Forwarded` header (and ignore `X-Forwarded` variants) by setting `quarkus.management.proxy.allow-forwarded` in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.management.proxy.allow-forwarded=true
----

Alternatively, you can prefer `X-Forwarded-*` headers using the following configuration in `src/main/resources/application.properties` (note `allow-x-forwarded` instead of `allow-forwarded`):
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.management.proxy.proxy-address-forwarding=true
quarkus.management.proxy.allow-x-forwarded=true
quarkus.management.proxy.enable-forwarded-host=true
quarkus.management.proxy.enable-forwarded-prefix=true
----

Supported forwarding address headers are:

* `Forwarded`
* `X-Forwarded-Proto`
* `X-Forwarded-Host`
* `X-Forwarded-Port`
* `X-Forwarded-Ssl`
* `X-Forwarded-Prefix`

If both header variants (`Forwarded` and `X-Forwarded-*`) are enabled, the `Forwarded` header will have precedence.

IMPORTANT: Using both `Forwarded` and `X-Forwarded` headers can have security implications as it may allow clients to forge requests with a header that is not overwritten by the proxy.

Ensure that your proxy is configured to strip unexpected `Forwarded` or `X-Forwarded-*` headers from the client request.

== Kubernetes

When Quarkus generates the Kubernetes metadata, it checks if the management interface is enabled and configures the probes accordingly.
The resulting descriptor defines the main HTTP port (named `http`) and the management port (named `management`).
Health probes (using HTTP actions) and Prometheus scrape URLs are configured using the `management` port.

.KNative
====
Until https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/8471[KNative#8471] is resolved, you cannot use the management interface, as KNative does not support containers will multiple exposed ports.
